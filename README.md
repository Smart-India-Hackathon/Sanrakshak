We are creating this project under the great mentorship of Prof. Shubham Gupta.. One of the most brilliant human I was fortunate to meet with in my life.

This App is contributed to those silent heroes who risks their lives under all the extreme harsh conditions on earth to Protect our environment and wildlife.
<br>
We salute the determination of those Forest Guards who work selflessly behind the curtains for keeping the balance of our Ecosystem fine.
<br>
If this project can even become slightly helpful to the working system of our nation for Protected Areas, our efforts will be successful.
